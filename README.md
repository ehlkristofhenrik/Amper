# Amper
 Amper - Software Based Acoustic Guitar Amplifier with effects using the Godot Game Engine

## Usage
1. Install the Amper APK on android, also works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and if you have Mac, you can compile to IOS. I don't have one so no release unfortunatelly.
2. Create the Effect combination you want, feel free to tweak the parameters and HAVE FUN!
3. Then use a jack separator cable to split the signal to in and output.
4. Connect the input (usually pink) to the external microphone
5. Connect the output (green one) to the speaker
6. Place the microphone close to the acoustic guitar as possible
7. Try to place the speaker far from the microphone to avoid feedback noise
8. ENJOY!
