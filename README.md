# Amper
 Amper - Software Based Acoustic Guitar Amplifier with effects using the Godot Game Engine

## How it works
It's not a real guitar amp, it only takes the input, applies some effect and sends it to the output. That's it.
I made this 'cause my guitar is acoustic and has no pickup system and those ain't cheap.
If you want to have better sound quality I'd advise buying acoustic pickups, an amp, cables and some effect pedals.
> This won't make it sound like an electric!

## Usage
1. Install the Amper APK on android, also works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and if you have Mac, you can compile to IOS. I don't have one so no release unfortunatelly.
2. Create the Effect combination you want with the nodes (using the add effect button), feel free to tweak the parameters and HAVE FUN!
3. Then use a jack separator cable to split the signal to in and output.
4. Connect the input (usually pink) to the external microphone
5. Connect the output (green one) to the speaker
6. Place the microphone close to the acoustic guitar as possible
7. Try to place the speaker far from the microphone to avoid feedback noise
8. Hit Record to activate the amp
9. ENJOY!

# IF YOU MADE SOME CHANGES, YOU NEED TO DISCONNECT & RECONNECT THE NODE TO TAKE EFFECT!
